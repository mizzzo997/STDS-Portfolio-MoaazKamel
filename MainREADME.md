# Moaaz Kamel - Software 2 Portfolio

## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio contains all tasks, assignments, and the final project completed during the semester for the Software 2 course. It demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming, design principles, design patterns, and testing practices using Python, Java, and JavaScript.

The portfolio reflects the student's technical skills, documentation abilities, and professional presentation.

## Repository Structure


## Tasks Summary
1. **OOP (Shapes Project)**  
   Models geometric shapes (Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, Square, Ellipse) and calculates their area and perimeter using Object-Oriented Programming principles. Demonstrates abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. **SOLID Principles Project**  
   Demonstrates the application of SOLID principles in Python with geometric shapes, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and adherence to OOP concepts.

3. **Design Patterns Project**  
   Applies multiple software design patterns such as Factory, Builder, Adapter, Decorator, Observer, Singleton, and Strategy to a shapes system.

4. **Unit Testing Project**  
   Demonstrates unit testing, boundary testing, mocking, observer testing, and automation-style execution for the shapes system.

## Final Project
The final project integrates concepts from all tasks, providing a robust system for modeling geometric shapes with scalable, maintainable, and testable code.
